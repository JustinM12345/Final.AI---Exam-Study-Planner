# 🎓 Final.AI - Exam Study Planner

### **1. How to Run the Program**

**Prerequisites**
* Python 3.9+
* A Google Cloud Project with the **Gemini API** enabled.
* An API Key saved in a `.env` file (`GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here`).

**Installation**
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Final.AI-Exam-Study-Planner.git](https://github.com/yourusername/Final.AI-Exam-Study-Planner.git)
    cd Final.AI-Exam-Study-Planner
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Requires: `google-adk`, `google-generativeai`, `pypdf`, `python-dotenv`)*

**Setup & Execution**
1.  **Add Your Textbooks:**
    * Create a folder named `uploaded_files` in the root directory.
    * Drag and drop your course PDFs (Syllabi, Textbooks, Midterm Overviews) into this folder.
    * *Note: The system automatically detects and sorts them.*

2.  **Run the Agent:**
    * If using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) CLI:
        ```bash
        adk run planner_agent
        ```
    * Follow the chat prompts to generate your schedule.

### **2. Brief Summary**
**Final.AI** is an autonomous multi-agent system designed to solve the "Student Planning Problem." Instead of manually scheduling hundreds of hours of study time, this tool takes **raw PDF inputs** (textbooks, slides, syllabi) and generates a **biologically realistic, hour-by-hour study itinerary**.

The system does not just "list tasks"; it understands difficulty. It knows that *Quantum Mechanics* requires more mental energy than *Intro to History*, and it schedules "High Focus" blocks accordingly. It outputs a formatted Markdown schedule that respects sleep, meals, and burnout limits.

### **3. Agent Architecture**
The system uses a **4-Agent Pipeline** to mimic a professional project management team:

#### 📂 **Agent 1: The Sorter (Librarian)**
* **Role:** Organizing the chaos.
* **Logic:** Scans the headers and filenames of every PDF in the `uploaded_files` directory. It uses Regex and LLM reasoning to group files into courses (e.g., categorizing "Week 1.pdf" and "Syllabus.pdf" under "PHYS 234").
* **Output:** A structured dictionary mapping Course Codes to File Paths.

#### 🧠 **Agent 2: The Analyst (Estimator)**
* **Role:** Assessing workload difficulty.
* **Logic:** Reads the Table of Contents and Syllabi for each sorted course. It calculates:
    * **Volume:** How many chapters need to be covered?
    * **Difficulty:** Is this a "High Focus" subject (Math/Physics) or "Low Focus" (Reading)?
    * **Time Budget:** Estimates the hours required to learn the material.
* **Output:** A list of specific study topics and time estimates (e.g., "Thermodynamics: 4 hours").

#### 🗓️ **Agent 3: The Scheduler (Architect)**
* **Role:** Creating the schedule.
* **Logic:** Takes the estimated workload and fits it into a calendar.
    * **Biological Defaults:** Enforces sleep (11 PM - 7 AM), Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.
    * **Interleaving:** Mixes subjects (e.g., Physics in the morning, History in the afternoon) for optimal retention.
    * **Review Buffer:** Ensures the last 48 hours before the deadline are reserved for "Review Only."

#### 🛡️ **Agent 4: The Auditor (Manager)**
* **Role:** Quality Control & Burnout Prevention.
* **Logic:** Reviews the draft schedule generated by Agent 3.
    * **Completeness Check:** "Did you forget to schedule the Physics Midterm?"
    * **Burnout Check:** "REJECTED: You scheduled 12 hours of work on Tuesday. The limit is 10 hours."
* **Action:** If the plan fails, Agent 4 rejects it and forces Agent 3 to rewrite the schedule with specific corrections.

### **4. Key Features & "The Extra"**

* **🔄 Self-Healing Feedback Loop:**
    The defining feature of this project. If Agent 3 creates a bad schedule (e.g., cramming 15 hours into one day), Agent 4 **automatically rejects it**. The system loops until a valid, healthy plan is approved. You can see this negotiation happen in real-time in the logs.

* **🧠 Biological Reality Engine:**
    Unlike standard calendar apps, this system assumes you are human. It hard-codes:
    * **Sleep Protection:** No tasks scheduled between 23:00 and 07:00.
    * **Meal Blocks:** Mandatory 1-hour breaks for Lunch and Dinner.
    * **Burnout Cap:** Strict 10-hour limit on "Intensive Study" per day.

* **📂 Local File Privacy:**
    The agents run locally on your machine's file system. Your textbooks are read from the `uploaded_files` directory and processed in memory; they are never permanently stored on an external server, preserving intellectual property and privacy.

* **📅 Context-Aware Date Logic:**
    The system is "Time Aware." It calculates the current date dynamically, preventing "Time Travel" hallucinations (e.g., scheduling exams for 2024). If no deadline is given, it defaults to a standard **14-Day Study Sprint**.
